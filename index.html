                        <p>The human body was designed to move, as evidenced by the three hundred and sixty joints in
                            the human skeletal system, and we all know that exercise is critical to maintaining optimal
                            health. When engaged appropriately, and according to one’s individual needs, exercise can be
                            a potent catalyst for improved health.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, modern life requires more and more of us to lead extraordinarily sedentary
                            lives, making movement and exercise more important than ever.</p>

                        <p>Beyond that, exercise activates natural pathways of rejuvenation by helping release
                            accumulated tension, clearing stagnant mental and emotional energy, improving our ability to
                            relax, and supporting sound sleep.</p>

                        <p>All of these benefits are understandably critical to our experience of optimal health.
                            Ideally, our fitness routines are grounding, energizing, and truly help us feel our
                            best—body, mind, and spirit.</p>

                        <h2><a id="too-much" name="too-much"></a>Is It Possible to Exercise Too Much?</h2>

                        <p>However, we live in a culture that glorifies exercise, hard work, and pushing the limits in
                            as many ways as possible. This worldview has undoubtedly infiltrated our perspective on
                            exercise. How often do you hear phrases like these?</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>No Pain, No Gain</li>
                            <li>Push It</li>
                            <li>Go Big or Go Home</li>
                            <li>Just Do It</li>
                            <li>Feel the Burn</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>As with many things, we have an obsessive relationship with exercise. We’re generally
                            conditioned to think that more is&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;better, and that pushing
                            ourselves to the limit is unquestionably preferable to taking it easy in our activities.</p>

                        <p>But Ayurveda offers a different view entirely.</p>

                        <h2><a id="ayurvedic" name="ayurvedic"></a>The Ayurvedic Perspective on Fitness</h2>

                        <p>One of the most elegant aspects of the Ayurvedic tradition is its incredible devotion to the
                            individual.</p>

                        <p>While aspects of the Ayurvedic lifestyle are generally suitable for everyone, Ayurveda
                            acknowledges that each of us is unique. What might be very therapeutic for one person can be
                            categorically harmful to another. The same is true of exercise.</p>

                        <p>Ayurveda’s fitness recommendations depend on one’s&nbsp;<a
                                href="https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/dosha-quiz/">constitution and current state

                            the surrounding climate, and the <a

                            By nature, exercise is qualitatively light, sharp, hot, mobile, clarifying, and drying.</p>

                        <p>One of the foundational principles of Ayurveda is that like increases like and that opposites
                            balance. Ideally, we can observe how each quality might interact with the energies already
                            at play within our bodies or the broader context of our lives (as with the current climate
                            or season).</p>

                        <p>At first glance, this perspective can feel a bit complicated, overwhelming, or overly
                            limiting, but with a bit of education, the Ayurvedic approach is actually quite intuitive.

                            Instead, there are many—each tailored to the unique needs of the individual. Ultimately, the

                        <p><strong>Exercise at 50 percent capacity.</strong> In general, Ayurveda recommends that we
                            exercise at just fifty percent of our capacity—until we break a mild sweat on the forehead,
                            under the arms, and along the spine, or until the first sign of dryness in the mouth.<sup><a
                                    href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">1</a></sup></p>

                        <p><strong>Breathe through your nostrils.</strong> You can help ensure an appropriate amount of
                            effort by breathing through your nostrils throughout your workout. This can feel challenging
                            at first, but it definitely gets easier with time and practice.</p>

                        <p>Most people gradually develop a tolerance for more and more intensity, as their nostrils
                            adapt to being the primary passageway for the breath during exercise.</p>

                        <p><strong>Work out at the right time of day</strong>. Ayurveda also recommends that we exercise
                            during the <a class="glossary_term js-banyan-tooltip-1"

                                data-tooltip="One of three functional energies in nature: vata, pitta, and kapha. In the body, it is the unique ratio of these three humors that determines an individual’s prakriti (constitution).

                            counteract the inherent lightness and mobility of physical activity.</p>

                        <p>And actually, because the qualities of exercise oppose the qualities of kapha, being active
                            at these times of day can counteract any tendency toward sluggishness, heaviness, or mental
                            fog that might otherwise dampen your sense of well-being.</p>

                        <p>If exercising during the kapha time of day is out of the question for you, find a time that

                        <p>Exercise has far more in common with vata and pitta than kapha, so exercising during pitta
                            times of day (10 a.m–2 p.m. and 10 p.m.–2 a.m.) and vata times of day (2–6 a.m. and p.m.)
                            can easily provoke these doshas.</p>

                        <p>Beyond these generalities, you can further improve the benefits of your fitness routine by
                            tailoring it to balance the specific dosha that needs the most support in your system.</p>
                     

                        <h2><a id="dosha" name="dosha"></a>How Do I Know Which Dosha to Support?</h2>

                        <p>When planning your fitness routine, it is helpful to know your constitution and current state
                            of balance. If you are new to these concepts, our simple&nbsp;<a
                                href="https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/dosha-quiz/">dosha quiz</a> can help you
                            determine yours.</p>

                        <p>As a general rule, exercise to support your current state of balance, which is generally a
                            reflection of all the various influences that may be affecting you at any given time—your
                            constitutional tendencies, your age, the season, and your lifestyle.</p>

                        <p>So if one or more of your doshas is aggravated, focus on balancing whichever one is the most
                            elevated. If you are relatively balanced, you can exercise to support your constitution,
                            balancing those doshas that are most predominant within your system—and yes, it is
                            definitely possible to create an exercise routine that combines the needs of more than one
                            dosha.</p>

                        <p>When you find that you are relatively balanced for an extended period of time, you may also
                            choose to adapt your routine according to your&nbsp;<a

                                of life</a>&nbsp;and make slight refinements as the seasons change. <a

                        <p>Remember, when an imbalance is present (which is the case for most of us), one should focus
                            on balancing whichever dosha is most aggravated. The beauty of this system is that you can
                            always refine your approach as your needs change.</p>
